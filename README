EARTHQUAKE MAP
I have written this code as a part of programming assignment course from coursera course Object Oriented Programming in Java

DESCRIPTION
This is simple java PApplet application which shows live earthquake data with the help of marker.
There are also city marker which helps to identiy if that particular city is affected by earthquake

TROUBLE SHOOTING

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
